# Tasklight

Project by: Cait Prough, Erol Guleyupoglu, Ling Zheng, and Anne Wu
=======
# TaskLight
The DUE date doesn't have to be the DO date!

## The Goal
By convincing you that an item you added to your to do list is due earlier than expected Tasklight essentially gaslights you into completing your tasks on time. 

## Technologies Used
* Reactive Native
* JavaScript
* Expo
* Github

## Challenges Faced
Our team was composed of members who did not have previous app design experience, and very litte JavaScript experience. We had to use teamworking skills and let everyone in the group work on what they were best at.

## Next Steps
Next steps for this project would include features such as a login screen so users could sync tasks between devices.
